## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
allow you to repeat a process over and over without having to write the same (potentially long) instructions each time you want your program to perform a task
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
When the first set of instructions is executed again
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
before executing the statement
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
before the statement is processed for the first time
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
 each time before the loop runs
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
at the last lap of the loop
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
increments (adds one to) its operand and returns the value before or after the increment
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
Object.keys()
